This Lab uses a dataset stored in spam.csv (in the current directory).
The original dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

Implement this class to use Pandas to read the data into a dataframe.

    # 1: num_rows (the number of rows in the dataset)
    # 2: num_spam (the number of rows labeled as spam)
    # 3: num_ham (the number of rows labeled as ham)
    # (In the security world, messages that are not spam are ham.)

# Factor out any redundant code into a helper method.
# You can ignore the rows that do not follow the correct format.
