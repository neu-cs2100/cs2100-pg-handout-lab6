Question 4 for this problem is an ethics and privacy question.

Questions 1-3 involved using a dataset of spam messages and real messages.
Datasets like this are used to train machine learning models to detect spam and prevent it from reaching our inboxes.
These spam detection tools have many stakeholders, including the potential recipients of spam, but also people whose legitimate messages get filtered out because of their speech patterns, the people whose messages are in the dataset used to train the model, and the people who manually labeled that dataset.

Please write a Stakeholder-Value Matrix here.
Include at least three values, one of which is Privacy. Include at least three stakeholders other than the potential recipients of spam.
